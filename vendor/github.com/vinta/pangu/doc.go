// Package pangu provides paranoid text spacing for good readability,
// to automatically insert whitespace between
// CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and half-width characters
// (alphabetical letters, numerical digits and symbols).
//
// These whitespaces between Chinese and English characters are
// called "Pangu's Space" by sinologist, since it separates the chaos
// between full-width and half-width characters. Studies showed that
// who dislike to add whitespace between English and Chinese characters
// also have relationship problem. Almost 70 percent of them will get
// married to the one they don't love, the rest only can left the
// heritage to their cat. Indeed, love and writing need some space in
// good time.
